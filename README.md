This was the old repository for the multiplayer mod before I stopped working on it. Temperz87 and a few other programmers continued where I left off in [this repo](https://github.com/Temperz87/VTOLVR-Multiplayer).

The mod uses SteamWorks.net which is a peer to peer networking solution inside of the steam API for developers, if you would like to contribute to the multiplayer mod head over to Temperz87's repo.
